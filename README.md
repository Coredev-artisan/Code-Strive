# Code-Strive: Guessing Game



**Getting started:**

Included in this repo are the following files:
 - `app.js` - This is where you will write all of your code
 - `index.html` - You will run this HTML file in your browser to run your code
 - `style.css` - Ignore for this project. This is to style the page, but your app will not be interacting directly with the webpage. 
 - `readme.md` - That is what you are reading right now. The file is in markdown format (.md), it's straight forward way to organize text content that Github understands. You don't need to know much more than that about it right now. 


# Furthur will be updates soon..
